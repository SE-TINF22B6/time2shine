# srs2shine
## Software Requirements Specification
> This template is a simplified version based on the documentation templates from IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP).
### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Overview
> A game hub where players can play and enjoy multiple different online games of different styles directly in their browsers, whitout having to install any software.
#### 1.2 Scope
> This document covers our whole project, in the future however we might split it up into two sections (probably frontend and backend).
#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
> **t2s:** abbrevation for "time2shine"
> **tbd:** to be done
#### 1.4 References
> A complete list of all documents referenced. Each document should be identified by title, date, and publishing organization. You can also insert hyperlinks, in order to open the references conviniently.

### 2. Functional requirements
>  This section contains all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.  
>  This section is typically organized by feature, but alternative organization methods may also be appropriate, for example, organization by user or organization by subsystem.

> [!NOTE]
> You can insert links to your UML diagrams and user stories, or labels of user stories into this document.

#### 2.1 Overview 
> A brief description of the functionality of your application.  
> Include one or more **UML use case** diagram(s) and necessary description to specify the major use cases of your application.

Link to our [UML diagram](https://github.com/SE-TINF22B6/time2shine/blob/main/uml.drawio) (draw.io format, not human-readable)


#### 2.2 Name of Feature 1 / Use Case 1
> Specify this feature / use case by:
> - Relevant **user stories (their links or labels)**
> - **UI mockups**
> - **UML behavior diagrams** and necessary text specification
> - **Preconditions**. *A precondition of a use case is the state of the system that must be present prior to a use case being performed.*
> - Postconditions. *A postcondition of a use case is a list of possible states the system can be in immediately after a use case has finished.*
> - **Estimated efforts (high, medium, low)**


#### 2.3 Name of Feature 2 / Use Case 2
... ...

### 3. Nonfunctional requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is not necessary to cover all of the following categories, but focus on what your project will implement.  
> If some nonfunctional requirements are described as user stories in your backlog, add their **links** in this section, or any information to guide the reader find them in your backlog, such as a **label** of those relevant user stories.

> Categories: Usability, Reliability, Performance, Efficiency, Integrity, Maintainability, Flexibility, Testability, Reusability, Security.  


### 4. Technical constraints
> Specify any major constraints, assumptions or dependencies, e.g., any restrictions about which type of server to use, which type of open source license must be complied, etc.
