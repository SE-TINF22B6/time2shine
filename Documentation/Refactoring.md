# Refactoring in the React/Next.JS frontend

We used the Google Lighthouse tool, which was previously presented in class. It showed us, that we have a lot of overhead in our frontend, which is caused by redundant TypeScript files that we used for the Page Layouts. Since we use the same layout for all pages, it is completely unnecessary to use the same layout file for each Sub-Page. 

This way, we could reduce the data transferred to a user when opening our web page.
