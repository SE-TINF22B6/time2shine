## Measurements
### Introduction
We measured three metrics for our website which are listed below. The page load time is measured by the website [pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/) that was also presented during one of our lectures. The measurement for user traffic and server load is taking digital ocean, the platform that our website runs on.
#### Page Load Timeâ€‹
Our page load performance is quite good with an rating of 88. It's rather quick with a loadtime of around half a second and has a size of only 2mb.

#### User Traffic
The second metric measures the user traffic by time. It is clearly visible that the user traffic currently is rather consistent with some ups and downs, apart from the major drop between 12pm and 06am.

#### Server Load
The server load shows the cpu usage that is required. We hosted our project on a sever with a rather big cpu cap, since nothing spoke against it. Therefore, there aren't any spikes above the 20% mark which is good.

### 2. Measure results and analysis
Given the fact that our website has a pretty big trailer video that has to be loaded too, the overall page load time seems good. In general when testing the website, it doesn't feel slow and no problems are detected when loading the website.

Since the website was still in development, we can assume that a total response of 676 within 24 hours is rather low since one could imagine that the play rate will only really start once the website is fully developed. Depending on the "success" of our website and whether or not people all around the world will play game on it, the big drop at night might flatten out due to different timezones and the overall request across the day might become more evenly distributed. 

We can also see that we still have a big margin for our cpu usage. This is because we have a pretty good deal for it at digital ocean and didn't have to pay for it, so there are no disadvatages in having this big of a margin. Therefore, we also won't have to wory about increasing our used cpu for the website for a rather long time.
